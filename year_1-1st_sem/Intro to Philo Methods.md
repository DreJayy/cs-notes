**ASKING MENO'S QUESTION**
	Meno begins by asking Socrates three main questions about **virtue**:
		1. Can virtue be taught?
		2. Is not teachable but comes from practice?
		3. Is it something that is innate, something that comes to us by nature?
		4. Or some other way?
	Socrates claims that he doesn't know what virtue is. He acknowledges that it can be advantageous, or a kind of wisdom, or guided by wisdom we still don't know what virtue is, but let's say if it is a kind of virtue, there should be teachers. Are there?
		-----
	Meno is used to the idea of looking for an answer to any question despite being complex. This is because Meno has been taught by Gorgias to "give a bold and grand answer to any question." This is acknowledged by Socrates, which he then shows his claim of ignorance on things he does not have knowledge on   
		-----
	Meno gave three definitions to Socrates:
		1 - Virtue as the Power to Rule Over People (Lines 41-42)
		2 - Virtue as Wanting and Acquiring Good Things (Lines 114-115)
		3 - Virtue as the Acquisition of Good Things with Justice (Lines 157-161) 
	Meno’s **first definition** is that **virtue is the ability to rule others**. Meno’s **second definition** is that virtue is both the **desire for good things** and the **ability to get them**. Meno **amends his second definition**: virtue is acquiring good things **justly, piously, etc.**
			-----
	Socrates refutes these definitions:
		1 - Not universal; must be done justly; just one part of virtue
		2 - Everyone desires good; acquiring goods isn’t always virtuous
		3 - Now listing **parts** (justice) instead of defining **whole** virtue
